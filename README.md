# plan

- supernote file to image (AI heavy lifting)
- image to pdf with vtracer - takes more space - stick with png
- we have to figure out the correct color mapping. currently we rely on undetected color being black.
- something simple like img2pdf (https://github.com/pstwh/img2pdf/tree/main) to combine pngs to a single file.
- but cool - the release build is quite fast for a single page. Still gotta benchmark
